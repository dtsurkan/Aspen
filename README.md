# Aspen

I got annoyed with Lumberjack, so I made my own logging framework called Aspen.

### Features

* Simple setup. There's a global/shared logging framework set up you can use with two lines of code.
* Console and/or file-based logging.
* Different levels per log.
* Convention over configuration.

### Installation

You can install Aspen through [Carthage][c] or as a Git submodule using the Aspen framework target.

There is currently not a podspec. See the below second for why.

### Support

Right now this is considered pretty early days. I'm probably going to break stuff as I figure out how I want to integrate it into my projects. You're welcome to use and contribute to it, but just know you're not dealing with a 1.0 yet.

Once things stabilize a bit more, I'll add in a podspec so that more people can easily use it.
